# Tom's Maze Chase

Tom's Maze Chase is an exciting game where players take control of Tom, the cat, in a challenging maze environment. The objective is to catch all the mice, led by Jerry, while avoiding obstacles and evading Spike, who is also on the hunt. Players must strategically navigate the maze, collect the power-up tile to gain temporary advantage, and outwit Spike to emerge victorious.
